Six Degrees of Freedom <br />
六自由度

From wiki: Six degrees of freedom (6DoF) refers to the freedom of movement of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. 

The six movements are described based on one 3-axis Cartesian coordinate system. They are devided into 2 category of movements: translation, and rotation. The object can change its position along 3 axis, which is translation. And the object can also rotate itself along 3 axis, which is rotation.
Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (normal axis), pitch (transverse axis), and roll (longitudinal axis).

任何一个没有受约束的物体，在空间中都可以进行6个独立的运动。
该物体在直角坐标系oxyz中可以有3个平移运动（平动位移）和3个转动（姿态角度）。3个平移运动分别是沿x,y,z轴的平移运动,3个转动分别是绕x,y,z轴的转动。习惯上把上述6个独立运动称做6个自由度。三个平移运动即前后平移(surge)、上下垂直位移（heave）和左右平移(sway)。三个转动即俯仰(pitch)、滚转(roll)、偏航(yaw)。
