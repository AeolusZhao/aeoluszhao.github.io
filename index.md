Recently(2018.11.05) I have started to learn GPU programming with OpenCL 2.0. The motivatin behind it is that this is the competence which is lacked in our current software cluster. So why not start to prepare, I thought. And based on my past experience, I am not that good at sticking to a new hobby as a long-term goal. What will happen this time, I don't know. I'll see.
