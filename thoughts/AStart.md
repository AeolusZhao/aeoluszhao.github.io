## A Start

Recently (2018.11.05) I have started to learn GPU programming with OpenCL 2.0. 

The motivatin is to fill the missing competence in our current software cluster. So why not start to prepare, I thought. But based on my past experience, I am not that good at sticking to a new hobby as a long-term goal. What will happen this time, I don’t know. 

I will use this website to record my thoughts, learning experience and maybe something else that I don't know yet.

Ok. Have fun.
