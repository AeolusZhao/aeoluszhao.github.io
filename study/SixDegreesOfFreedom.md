Six Degrees of Freedom 
六自由度

From wiki: Six degrees of freedom (6DoF) refers to the freedom of movement of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. 

The six movements are described based on one 3-axis Cartesian coordinate system. They are devided into 2 category of movements: translation, and rotation. The object can change its position along 3 axis, which is translation. And the object can also rotate itself along 3 axis, which is rotation.
Specifically, the body is free to change position as forward/backward (surge), up/down (heave), left/right (sway) translation in three perpendicular axes, combined with changes in orientation through rotation about three perpendicular axes, often termed yaw (normal axis), pitch (transverse axis), and roll (longitudinal axis).
